This is a program that takes in an epub formated book or a text formated book
and produces a list of csv files.  It will hopefully end up being more
than what it is right now.  Currently this program reads in a few different
Bulgarian-English Dictionaries and an epub or a text file book in Bulgarian
and produces a CSV of word pairs for each chapter with the first word being
the word in the book and the second word being the word's entry in a Bulgarian-
English Dictionary.

It currently requires wget, sed, python, vim, and mwlib.
