This is a program that takes in an epub formated book or a text formated book
and produces a list of csv files.  It will hopefully end up being more
than what it is right now.  Currently this program reads in a few different
Bulgarian-English Dictionaries and an epub or a text file book in Bulgarian
and produces a CSV of word pairs for each chapter with the first word being
the word in the book and the second word being the word's entry in a Bulgarian-
English Dictionary.

It currently requires python and ipython; it also requires either a dictionary or mwlib.xhtml.

I haven't decided on the final license for this, so everything that is mine is
released under an Apache 2.0 lincense for now.  See LICENSE.txt
